# KnightOS image formats

**Note**: All details may change before the initial release.

Images, due to their potential size, can be compressed or uncompressed and using a
palette or not. This information is given in a header defined as follows:

| Address | Length  | Description                            |
|:--------|:--------|:---------------------------------------|
| 0x0000  | 4       | The literal ASCII string "KIMG"        |
| 0x0004  | 1       | A format byte (see below)              |
| 0x0005  | 2       | A width word (in pixels)               |
| 0x0007  | 1       | A height byte (in pixels)              |
| 0x0008  | 1       | How many palette entries if necessary  |
| 0x0009  | - - - - | 2-bytes palette entries if necessary   |
| - - - - | - - - - | Image data                             |

The format byte is defined as follows:

| Bit 7 | 6 | 5 |       4 - 3      |     2    |   1 - 0    |
|:------|:--|:--|:-----------------|:---------|:-----------|
| - - - | - | - | Compression type | Palette? | Color type |

The width must not be over 320 for a color image and not over 96 for a monochrome
image, and the height must not be over 240 for a color image and not over 64 for a
monochrome image.

A monochrome image can not use a palette, but can be compressed. The compression
technique used is defined by two bits as follows:

|       00       | 01  |    10    |           11            |
|:---------------|:----|:---------|:------------------------|
| No compression | RLE | Pucrunch | Reserved for future use |

The color type is also defined by two bits:

|     00     |       01       |           10           |            11           |
|:-----------|:---------------|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Monochrome | Color (RGB565) | Color+Alpha (RGBA5551) | Reserved for future use |

If the image is both compressed and paletted, it should be decompressed and then
displayed using the palette that will result of the decompression. If the image
uses no palette, that means the image data should be located at offset 0x0008. The
compression **can never apply** to the ASCII string "KIMG", the format byte, the
width word or the height byte. If you want to compress your data, you **must**
start compressing from 0x0008.

## Raw image data

This is a "normal" image ; uncompressed and using no palette, it's already ready
for direct write to the LCD or a screen buffer. They are the fastest image type to
work with, but can rapidly take a lot of memory. For a color image, each pixel is
encoded in R5G6B5 format, thus taking two bytes. For a monochrome image, each byte
encodes 8 pixels.

The header for a raw monochrome image would be as follows:

{% highlight nasm %}
    .db "KIMG"
    .db 0b00000000 ; non-compressed and non-paletted monochrome image
    .dw 96 ; width of 96 pixels
    .db 64 ; height of 64 pixels
    .db 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff ; one row is 12 bytes since 12 * 8 = 96 pixels
    ; etc ...
{% endhighlight %}

And the header for a raw color image would be the same, except that the format
byte would be `0b00000001` and each pixel would be two bytes long instead of one
bit long.

## Paletted images

Only color images can use palettes. Instead of using two bytes per pixel to
indicate its color in RGB565 or RGBA5551 format, each pixel is one byte and is
used as an offset to a table of colors.

The header for a paletted color image would be as follows:

{% highlight nasm %}
    .db "KIMG"
    .db 0b00000011 ; paletted color image
    .dw 16
    .db 16
    .db 4 ; 4 possible colors
    .dw 0x0000, 0x00f1, 0xe007, 0x1f00 ; the 4 colors
    .db 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3 ; 16 one-byte pixels
    ; etc ...
{% endhighlight %}
